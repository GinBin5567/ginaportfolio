             <h1> Hackathon 1 </h1>
             <p> During the first Hackathon, my partner and I were tasked with creating a website for an animal breeder. As this was the end of the first day, we didn't really know much about CSS, but we used what little we knew to code a website for a client by the name of Ann Perkins, who sold Labradors, Doodles, and Labradoodles.</p>

             <h1> Hackathon 2 </h1>
             <p> The second Hackathon was more difficult, as we were given a HTML file that we could not edit directly, only alter from CSS. This project was based on a client by the name of Dr. Drew, who wanted a site to advertise the health benefits of beets to the general public. </p>
